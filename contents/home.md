#### About me
I am Dianjun Lin, a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Pennsylvania State University, advised by Professor Bing Li and Professor Lingzhou Xue. Prior to this, I earned my Master’s degree (2020–2022) from the Institute of Statistics and Big Data at Renmin University of China. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Nankai University in 2020.

My primary research focuses on graphical models and dimension reduction methods for analyzing functional and non-Euclidean data, with applications in brain imaging, networks, and high-dimensional data. Additionally, I am also working on topics related to nonconvex optimization.

I am currently seeking a summer internship for 2025, particularly in finance, tech, biotech, or banking, where I can apply my expertise in statistics and machine learning. If you have relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out!

If you would like to get in touch, you can contact me via email.
